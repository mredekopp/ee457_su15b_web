##Lab 4

** Due Sat. 7/25 (electronic submission) at 11:59 PM (PST)**

** Only do the PART 2 - ROB (Out-of-Order Execution) and not the first part (In-order execution).**

### Handout 
Read Part 2 of the [lab 4 handout](http://ee.usc.edu/~redekopp/ee457/IoE_OoE_Divider.pdf)

### Procedure
**In teams of 2**

- Download the [skeleton file and testbench file](http://ee.usc.edu/~redekopp/ee457/ROB_P2.zip) which contains many completed design files (testbench, single-divider, etc) and the `OoE_Divider.v` file which you need to complete.  Follow the instructions in the handout and the comments in the file itself to complete the design.  

- When you run the testbench it should log your results to a file `OoE_output_results.txt` (i.e. you should check this file first and compare it to `OoE_golden_results.txt`) then and only then do you likely need to look at waveforms to debug any errors.  

### Submission

Place the name of you and your partner in the first line of your completed `OoE_Divider.v`.  Submit that file on the **[EE 457 DEN Desire2Learn site](https://courses.uscden.net/d2l)** in the **Lab 4 dropbox** under the **Lab Submission Folder/Section** .
